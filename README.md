#  LeetCode | DSA | Coding | Practice Repository

Welcome to my coding practice repo! 

I'm **Colby Threlkeld**, a Computer Science student at Georgia State University, on schedule to graduate in May 2027. This repository is where I store my coding practice problems using Python, JavaScript, SQL, and Pandas. This repo helps me sharpen my problem-solving skills in preparation for technical interviews and real-world challenges. 

My main goal is for the repository to function as a resource for both myself and others to explore, review, and learn from previously solved problems.
