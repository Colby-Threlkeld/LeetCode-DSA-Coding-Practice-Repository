# 🧠 LeetCode | DSA | Coding | Practice Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode practice repo!  
I'm **Colby Threlkeld**, a Computer Science student at Georgia State University, and this repository is where I track my progress solving algorithmic problems using Python and JavaScript. This repo helps me sharpen my problem-solving skills in preparation for technical interviews and real-world challenges.

## 📌 Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of LeetCode solutions
- A way to organize problems by topic and difficulty
- A public log of my growth as a developer and problem solver
